###1. INTRODUCTION

**Seikou's Role Playing Game Kit** is a python module used in the creation of RPG tools utilizing the Dungeon's & Dragons 5th edition rule set. It should be noted that this software is not officially developed or endorsed by Wizard of the Coast LLC.


###2. INSTALLATION

Simply unzip the contents to a directory of your choosing. The module comes in two parts. The 'database' directory should be placed in the root directory of the application you're developing. The 'seikourpg' folder should then be copied to the 'Lib' directory of your Python installation. This is important as the module relies upon this database to function.
