### 1. Introduction

**Personae RPG Library** is a python library used in the creation of RPG tools utilizing the Dungeon's & Dragons 5th edition rule set. Primarily, I've been using the module to develop a tool to randomly generate characters for my DnD games. It should be noted that this software is not officially developed or endorsed by Wizard of the Coast LLC.
