### 1. Introduction

This module is a generic set of tools for use for Dungeons & Dragons 5e characters. Originally, I developed the module to set up a basic framework for a GUI character editor and prior to this a CLI character editor. I've since started using it as a Python exercise, using it to become more competent with Python LOL. I've scrapped the GUI editor for the time being.

It should be noted that this software is not officially developed or endorsed by Wizard of the Coast LLC.
